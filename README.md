Cross-Sectional Econometric Analysis on Gender and Racial Inequality

This project is associated with SDG 5 (Gender equality), including other societal discrimination on gender, region, and indigenous status. 
The purpose of this project is to utilize different econometric methods involving linear regression models.
Econometric methods utilized include model development, heteroskedasticity, weighted least squares, interaction terms, and logarithmic transformations
These methods were implemented to develop a robust model in which its estimators are unbiased.
Interaction terms were included to capture combined effects of certain variables beyond their individual ones.
This is to be able to make reliable and accurate statistical inferences on the prescence of racial/gender inequality in the Australian population.
